                    Tornadogensis is the process in which a tornado forms. The study conducted is to determine the occurrence of tonadogensis by analyzing multiple severe weather parameters. The occurrence of tornadogensis was analyzed through the parameters precipitable water, lifting condensation level pressure, lifting condensation height, level of free convection height, level of neutral buoyancy, lifted index, K index, Showalter index, totals totals index, convective potential available energy, and convective inhibition. The various parameters listed are all part of a /derived/. CSV file that was downloaded and displayed in a data frame. Various methods were executed to analyze data and display charts and measures of central tendency and variation. The magnitude and number of tornadoes depended on the independent values listed. After, Out of the parameters, convective potential available energy and convective inhibition are the most critical parameters out of the various variables. The data did support the correlation of CIN playing a prominent role in tornado development and inhibition, but CAPE did not have any significant correlation towards tornado development.

Understanding parameters conducive to tornadogensis will produce a greater knowledge of tornado development. The knowledge gathered from the results could impact the broader field of meteorology and the predictive nature of the field. As in
many subject matters, history is the best way to predict and learn how different phenomena work and behave (NSSL). Pinpointing a parameter or various parameters can help by focusing on them and ensuring they are closely looked at when issuing watches and warnings. 
After getting a grasp of our current understanding, it is important to figure out how the significance of each parameter can affect the occurrence of tornadogensis through analysis. The parameters being observed and analyzed using past data are precipitable water (PW), lifting condensation level pressure (LCLPRESS), lifting condensation height (LCLHGT), level of free convection height (LFCHGT), level of neutral buoyancy (LNBHGT), LI, K index (KI), Showalter index (SI), totals totals index (TTI), CAPE, and convective inhibition (CIN). As mentioned previously, many parameters conducive to tornado and supercell development are needed, but not all can be covered in one paper. 
With the parameters listed above, it is vital to understand the ones not previously mentioned. Precipitable water is the amount of water in the atmosphere that can fall as precipitation. LCLPRESS is the pressure at the LCL level. LCLHGT is the height at which the LCL is. LFCHGT is the height where free convection exists. LNBHGT is the height at which a rising parcel of air is at the same temperature as its environment. KI measures the thunderstorm potential based on lapse rates and the low-level moisture content available in the atmosphere. SI is the stability index to determine the thunderstorm potential in the atmosphere. TTI is the totals totals index which indicates the probability of the occurrence of a thunderstorm and its severity.

The data collected from the data frames was vast and included lots of information. The first raw data table included all derived values in Norman, OK. Every reading from 2007 onwards was present, as well as no “-99999” values in CAPE or CIN (see table 1A&1B). The second raw data table included all of the actual reported tornadoes from 2007 onwards, as well as being all in the state of OK (see table 2A&2B). In the next data frame, the calculated values were displayed. The calculated values included the magnitude of the tornado and the number of tornadoes. In this data frame, many values return “0” for the number of tornadoes for that given day and return “-9” to indicate no values. In the calculated data table, many days include no tornadoes, with some days having enough parameters to produce tornadoes (see table 3). Next, the descriptive statistics displayed the various measures of central tendency and variation. For the first parameter, f_scale, looking at the mean value and the percentiles, 90% of the time, no tornadoes are formed with sufficient parameters in place (see table 4A).
Though this may be because not all parameters for tornadogensis are listed, but supports the idea of no tornadoes forming most times. Additionally, for the number of tornadoes, 90% of values read zero tornadoes reported (see table 4A). Looking at the correlation coefficient towards the f_scale is essential as it compares two variables and gives a value determining if it is correlated with another. Most values did not come up as very high correlation coefficient numbers, but CAPE and TTI were ~0.18, which meant they were not very similar to the f_scale (see table 4B). They were of greater significance, though, compared to the other values. The p-values displayed for each of the variables listed had an alpha < 0.005, so they were statistically significant (see table 5). A chi-squared test was done for the p-values to compare to the expected statistical data (i.e., mean values, Stdev). Moving on from the data tables, there were various statistical analysis graphs displayed. Specifically, CIN and CAPE factors were tested because they were stated in my research hypothesis. The first figure shown is a scatterplot that looks at the correlation between CAPE and CIN and the resulting tornadoes formed from it (see figure 14). From the scatter plot, the data shows that many high CAPE or low CIN days still lead to no reported tornadoes. The next figure shows a scatterplot without the no tornado days (see figure 15). Many tornadoes appear when the CIN value is on or about 0. CAPE has no clear trends and only shows scattered values in the plot. The IQR values showing the correlation between tornado severity and CAPE have some statistical significance and show trends (see figure 16). Lower CAPE values tend to support weaker tornadoes, and higher CAPE values tend to support stronger tornadoes. Though this is true, there are a lot of overlapping segments per CAPE value. For example, a day with a CAPE value of 4,000 could produce an F0 tornado or up to an F5 tornado. Additionally, all days without tornadoes could have CAPE values ranging from 0-9000, so CAPE values are inconsistent. Lastly, looking at the CAPE values per F-rated tornado and seeing the count of tornadoes is a measure that can be used to formulate conclusions. F0, F1, and F2 tornadoes display a high number of tornadoes when CAPE is lower. Contrastingly, when CAPE increases, the tornadoes slowly decrease (see figures 17-19). F3 tornadoes max out around 3,000 to 4,000 CAPE and slowly decrease as CAPE increases (see figure 20). F4 and F5 tornadoes are rarer; thus, there are no data trends except that they could happen in
relatively low CAPE environments as well as very high CAPE environments (see figures 21-22). The results garnered from the various statistical, and graphical analyses support that half of the hypothesis is true. The CIN has a major impact as it blocks moisture and thunderstorm development (Michael 2012). On the other hand, the CAPE had no 
statistical trends though it was hypothesized that the more CAPE in the environment, the severity and amount of tornadoes would increase. CAPE is a value that represents how much an air pocket can rise from its density (Michael 2012). Warm, moist air rises as cold, drier air sinks. CAPE values can be extremely high even if no precipitation or storm is incoming due to high dew points. This happens during the summer when it is hot and humid outside (Michael 2012). Some external factors out of control were in play. Marginal errors in data tables or different values could be rooted in the data tables given. Additionally, various computers being used to run the program could have had slight discrepancies in the results. In conclusion, the results support CIN being a major factor in tornadogensis, but CAPE has no real statistical trends to support being a major factor all of the time.
